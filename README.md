# Perceptron

This is a Perceptron training program implemented using Raylib. The Perceptron is designed to learn how to solve various logic gates, excluding the XOR gate due to its non-linear separability.

## Current Features:

- Initiate and halt the Perceptron.
- Adjust the program speed.
- Select different logic gates for training.

Feel free to explore the functionalities of this program and witness the Perceptron in action as it learns to tackle different logic gates (excluding the XOR gate).
